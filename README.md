# 🎧 Adaptive Shuffle – A Smarter Spotify Recommendation Engine

Are you tired of Spotify's shuffle mode ignoring your mood?  
This project introduces **Adaptive Shuffle** — a feature-based, session-aware music recommendation engine that learns from your **played and skipped songs**.

---

## 💡 Why I Built This

I noticed that Spotify's shuffle mode didn't adapt when I skipped multiple songs — it just kept playing random tracks. So I built a system that actually learns from what I skip and what I vibe with — in real time.

---

## 🧠 What This System Does

- ✅ Learns from the **features of the songs you play**
- ❌ Avoids the **traits of skipped songs**
- 🎯 Recommends top 5 similar tracks using **cosine similarity**
- 📊 Evaluates predictions using **feature-based accuracy**
- 🧪 Visualizes how well recommendations match your taste

---

## 🔬 Dataset Used

- [Spotify Dataset 1921-2020 (160k tracks)](https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/yamaerenay/spotify-dataset-1921-2020-160k-tracks)
- Contains audio features like valence, danceability, energy, acousticness, etc.

## 🚀 Key Features

- Feature-based recommendation using `valence`, `energy`, `tempo`, etc.
- Adaptive logic: focuses on the **last 10 played** songs
- (Optional) Skipped song penalty to sharpen accuracy
- Accuracy scoring via **cosine similarity** between played and recommended tracks
